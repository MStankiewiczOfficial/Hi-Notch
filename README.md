***Hi Notch!*** makes using your MacBook even more productive. It displays additional buttons and statuses of active applications such as web browsers, Apple Music, Microsoft Teams and Zoom.

## Available functions

### Turnouts
* **Mission Control** - quick access to Mission Control from any window.
* **Siri** and **Screen Saver** - call Siri and lock screen directly from the Desktop.
* **Window management** - left, right, top, bottom - you choose where you want the active window to go (based on [Andreas Hegenberg](https://community.folivora.ai/u/andreas_hegenberg/)'s preset).
* **Arc Browser** - quickly ask ChatGPT or search on website.
* **Google Chrome**, **Mozilla Firefox**, **Safari** and **other browsers** - copy URL from active tab or search on website.

### Statuses
* **Battery level** - the battery level appears on the left side of the Notch. Is something covered up? Hide it by double-clicking on Notch!
* **Music** and **multimedia** - pause and resume multimedia, and check the title and artist of the song being played when you hover the cursor over it.
* **Conferences** - mute or unmute and leave the meeting with one click (currently supported apps: *Microsoft Teams (work or school)* and *Zoom*).

### NotchAssistant
Save time! In Word, Pages and Mail applications, you can use the help of artificial intelligence. All you have to do is type in a text box what you want to appear, and at the click of a button it will turn it into a masterpiece!

**...and much more features!**

You will get a notification about new updates every time you run BetterTouchTool (can be turned off in preset settings; click Battery Level Status to open settings).
